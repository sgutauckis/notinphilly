      <dt class="faq-heading">So, what is <strong>Not in Philly</strong> all about?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>Like you, we realize that Philadelphia has a litter problem. As citizens, we have what it takes to make a real difference.</p> 
        <p>In return for a six month commitment to going out once a week to pick up litter, we will give you a trash grabber. No more touching litter or killing your back! You will be amazed at how much we can get done together!<p>
        <p>We welcome your questions and feedback. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:notinphilly@gmail.com">notinphilly@gmail.com</a>.</p>

      <dt class="faq-heading">All I get is a grabber? Isn’t that kind of lame?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>We agree. <strike>Once enough people sign up, we will be able to solicit gifts from area businesses and hold raffles to improve our rewards.</strike> Hub Bub Coffee has donated gift cards for those who post pictures of their cleaned blocks to @notinphilly and #notinphilly (if your account is public). We’ll have drawings of those who submit content while supplies last. Thank you for being a trailblazer! </p>

      <dt class="faq-heading">What if my block is too large to cover by myself?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>If you live on a large block, you can take care of just one side of the street.</p>
        <p>Get your neighbors involved! There can be multiple participants for each block.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">Why do you ask for my company or organization name?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>We appreciate the companies, non-profits, and houses of worship that are encouraging their members to take part in the <strong>Not in Philly</strong> street beautification project. By knowing how you found us, we can thank them by sharing in the good press coverage that we receive!</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">What if I move or am unable to complete my six month commitment?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>Please keep the grabber as our gift and eliminate litter wherever you go!</p>
